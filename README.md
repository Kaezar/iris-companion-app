This is a major work in progress at the moment, but the goal of this project is to make a web app which keeps track of various details in tabletop roleplaying games such as turn order and dice rolling. I also plan to have it integrate with my Iris Discord bot in order to access saved dice rolls and track users based on their Discord accounts.
